<!--- Product intention --->

I want to build a web app to help people who search a job, Let's call this app Jearch. Jearch will act as virtual career coach, kind of.

Jearch must have all classical authentication features.

Do to its magic, the user must first give information about her career path. Instead of giving a resume, the user enters her professional experience, one at a time, following the STAR format.

Or course, the user can change an experience, delete one, and add a new one, as well as navigating among all experiences.

The user shall be able to deal with her extra-professional experience, with STAR format as well, to help Jearch building a comprehensive profile.

The user shall be able to enter her education, with classical information.

<!--- User experience --->

The user experience must be intuitive and easy to use. The app must be responsive and accessible on all devices.
